# Aurora Explorer

Here is a simple little program I created back in college to fetch, map, and display the current aurora
forecast on a map live using the haversine formula.

I wanted to add time controls, speed, etc. TODO, I suppose.

## Usage:
```sudo pacman -S tk``` or your distros/OS equivalent. </br>
```python main.py```
